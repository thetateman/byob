Sometimes, for some people, this is a self-evident truth, but if this is not the case for the reader, perhaps you will accept a simple Christian argument: God is The Creator; the ability and will to create are intrinsic attributes of God. Mankind is made in the image of God, i.e., in His likeness, i.e., with like attributes. Therefore, we humans, as image-bearers, create in our own way. Perhaps there is also an argument to convince the Redditor, I do not know. Regardless, as a Christian and a self-evident-truth-enjoyer, I know that I can create, and must create in order to become closer to God by embodying His attributes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">I have attempted to mentally pin down and examine the will to create within myself. From what I can tell, it is like pure potential energy, like pressure in a vessel. It has no inherent orientation, it may be actively and arbitrarily directed. It is like a muscle, it must be allowed to move. However, if not directed, it becomes stale, and then rotten. And then the rot spreads. What is the rot? The rot is something like despair-depression-death. It is sinking further into an old, stained sofa and lighting another joint. Rot is one more episode. Rot is everything-is-going-fine. Rot is another year gone by. Everything is always growing or rotting, living or dying. There is no stasis. Is this not self-evident? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">If rot has been allowed to spread, can it be surgically removed, can it be excised? &nbsp;To remove rot we must know rot, we must distinguish it from healthy tissue. How do we know rot? Rot begets rot (we know this, see &ldquo;kipple&rdquo; (P. Dick) or yeast in the Bible). Rot camouflages itself, blending into its background, pretending to be nothing. Rot is heterotrophic. Rot is entropogenic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c10">Maybe explicitly understanding rot is unnecessary. It might be enough that we know what kills rot. Observation of nature comports with Jesus&rsquo; prescription of </span><span class="c4">salt</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4">light</span><span class="c3">. What are salt and light? For one, literal salt and literal light kill both literal and metaphorical rot. Light allows perception. Salt heals, preserves, and flavors. Seek the referents of &ldquo;salt&rdquo; and &ldquo;light&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c10">Otherwise we know that mental space-time must be occupied by creation to prevent rot from gaining a foothold. One must create, or at least attempt to create, daily. Create anything. Not for the sake of the product, but because the act of creation is necessary to fend off rot, to remain alive, to remain human. It is good to produce something good, but attempting to create anything non-trivial is a formidable battle when rot is winning the war. Start by actively directing creative energy somewhere: draw, write, code, carve, compose, paint, make something, anything, today. Later you can worry about making it better. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
